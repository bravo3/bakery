Bravo3 Bakery
=============

    -- Early Development --
    Contributions welcome! This project is an active prerequisite for a larger project.
    If you'd like to advance the development, shoot me a message to become a collaborator.


The purpose of this library is to provide support to run "bakery" operations on a remote host. These operations would
include:

* Installing and updating system packages for `yum` and `apt-get` Linux distributions
* Cloning code repositories
* Running set up scripts
* Miscellaneous scripts
* Run unit tests

The bakery should be able to:

* Run interactively
* Be able to use sudo

Consider:

* Saving artifacts
